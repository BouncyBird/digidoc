<ul class="list-disc pb-2">
    <li>Take naps. A 10-20 minute nap gives you mental alertness and lets you feel rejuvenated</li>
    <li>Think of things to be thankful for. You might feel scared or anxious of what will happen next, but if you
        realize what you have and how much you have, you will feel more relieved.</li>
    <li>Question why you feel anxious. Is the worry realistic? What would make you feel better about what you are
        worried about.</li>
    <li>Drink water. studies have shown that dehydration can cause the bravest of people to worry about the simplest
        things. Drinking water will make you feel better</li>
    <li>Exersize. While this isnâ€™t as useful as napping or drinking releasing endorphins will relieve stress and make yo
        feel happier.</li>
</ul>
